            In late 2023, Yun and Pei (pseudonyms), two young people from
            China’s Sichuan Province, were scrolling Kuaishou, a popular Chinese
            live-video platform, when they noticed what looked like a promising
            opportunity.
          </p>
          <p class="map_step pinned_content">
            Barely 17 and 20, they were scraping a living on construction sites
            around their hometown, and here was a job that promised to pay a
            daily wage that was nearly double what they were earning, plus food
            and lodging.
          </p>
          <p class="map_step pinned_content">
            After receiving a first positive response, they embarked on a
            journey to a coastal city in Guangxi Province for an interview in
            person. There, their enthusiasm quickly turned to fear, as the
            supposed prospective employer resorted to threats of violence to
            coerce them onto a boat.
          </p>
          <p class="map_step pinned_content">
            Within half an hour they were in Vietnam, where they spent a couple
            of days under guard in a hotel before being transported by car to
            Bavet, a Cambodian border town.
          </p>
          <p class="map_step pinned_content">
            In Bavet, they were brought to a compound known for hosting both
            online gambling and cyber-fraud operations and told that they would
            have to engage in online scams.
          </p>
          <p class="pinned_content">
            Unwilling, the two youths tried to escape but got caught by security
            guards and beaten badly. After spending several days locked up
            inside the dormitory, they agreed to learn scam techniques.
          </p>
          <p class="pinned_content">
            Moved to another compound to be trained, in a strike of luck, they
            managed to contact relatives back in China, who promptly reported to
            authorities in China and the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia.
          </p>
          <p class="map_step pinned_content">
            Finally, in January of this year, they were rescued by Cambodian
            police.

        <p class="basic_margin">
          Over the past few years, we have come across hundreds of stories that
          are just more or less tragic variations of this one. Individuals of
          various backgrounds and nationalities find themselves trapped inside
          compounds in Southeast Asia — mostly in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and
          the Philippines — where they are trained in various scam techniques
          and then forced to defraud people all over the world.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Some of them are there after being duped or drafted against their
          will, prevented from leaving, subjected to round-the-clock
          surveillance, and disciplined through the constant threat of arbitrary
          physical violence.

          On one side are the targets of the scams, who often lose the savings
          of a lifetime and go through horrible psychological suffering, an
          ordeal that leaves them with their sense of self-worth in tatters and,
          in some cases, on the brink of suicide. **JB: stats on how much has

          themselves, people like Yun and Pei, who end up working in scam
          operations in conditions akin to modern slavery after getting tricked

        <p class="basic_margin">
          In the second half of the decade, pioneering scammers started
          experimenting with some of the sophisticated techniques of online
          fraud that we are still seeing today.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder float_left">
          image: scratch card example
        </div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          In one of the most notorious instances, local crime syndicates created
          a popular scratch-card lottery in which lottery buyers were led to
          believe they had won a prize and then asked them to pay taxes on their
          winnings before collecting.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          As law enforcement in Taiwan became increasingly strict, starting from
          the early 2000s the focus of the scammers turned to mainland China.
          Online scam cases first made major headlines in China in 2004, with a
          case involving a well-known retired professor from a university in
          Beijing. After being scammed out of a significant amount of money for
          a television set and laptop that he was told were a lottery prize, the
          man sent a complaint to top leaders in the central government.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          This set in motion an investigation that eventually revealed that the
          scammer was an 18-year-old woman in a county in Fujian Province called
          Anxi.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Around the same time, another high-profile online fraud case was
          reported to the police, and the operator behind it also turned out to
          be based in Anxi.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          This was the beginning of the county developing a reputation as a
          "scam township" (zhapian zhi xiang). Suddenly, the place was receiving
          huge attention not only from the Chinese media and public, but also
          from law enforcement bodies.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder float_right">
          image: Chinese compound from 2004
        </div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          According to Chinese media reporting from that time, Anxi’s scam
          operations worked on a family-based model, supplemented by the hiring
          of external workers. These employees received either a fixed monthly
          salary of 500 yuan or a commission ranging from 10 to 20% of the money
          they generated. They were provided with food and accommodation,
          usually in a sealed-window suite, a characteristic that eerily recalls
          the situation of today’s scam compounds, even though we have no
          evidence that these workers were coerced to perpetrate the scams they
          engaged in.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          More broadly, these early operations already showed one landmark
          characteristic of online scam operations, that is the fact that,
          contrary to what many observers of the industry believe, they are
          mostly run by smaller groups of entrepreneurial Chinese-ethnic
          criminals, rather than "traditional" organised crime groups, such as
          Hong Kong triads.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          These developments led to increasingly strict law enforcement on the
          mainland. In the early 2010s, with scammers now having to find new
          bases for their operations, Southeast Asia — especially Cambodia and
          the Philippines — emerged as their destinations of choice.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          As they reviewed media and police reports of arrests and repatriations
          of Chinese nationals suspected of online fraud, two Chinese scholars
          were not able to locate any reports of large-scale arrests in
          Southeast Asia before 2011, an indication that at that time the
          industry had not taken roots in the region yet.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          They found a spike in arrests in the region only in 2015, in
          concomitance with a renewed crackdown on online fraud in China.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          This gives us a glimpse of the main push factor that leads crime
          groups to leave one location, that is, the need to escape regulatory
          changes and police crackdowns.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          As for the pull side, scam operators are attracted by regulatory
          voids, lax law enforcement, and existence of local elites and networks
          willing to grant their protection. As Chinese-ethnic criminal groups
          control many of these organisations, proximity to both Taiwan and
          mainland China is helpful, so that the fraudsters can easily travel
          back and forth and secure a steady supply of Chinese-speaking workers.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          It also helps if the destination has decent existing infrastructure,
          especially in terms of internet connectivity, telecommunications, and
          office space. This is the same type of infrastructure that is required
          for online gambling, which explains why the online scam industry has
          taken roots in country where online gambling is (or used to be)
          legally allowed or tolerated as an informal source of revenue.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="block_content">
        <h2 class="sub_head">Zooming In</h2>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          The gambling-scam nexus is particularly evident in Cambodia and the
          Philippines. In Cambodia, **where we have done the vast majority of
          our research,** the government initially allowed online gambling but
          then suddenly banned it in August 2019, citing public security
          concerns linked to the industry.
        </p>

        <div class="basic_margin media_placeholder">image: old casino?</div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          This move left behind a significant infrastructure ready for scammers
          to use, especially in places like the coastal city of Sihanoukville,
          which since 2017 had seen a significant influx of foreign investment
          in the casino and entertainment industry, mostly coming from
          Chinese-ethnic actors.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          In the Philippines, in 2016 the Duterte administration decided to
          regulate the industry by establishing the ‘Philippine Offshore
          Gambling Operations’ (POGO) scheme, a new policy that enabled online
          gambling firms to legally set up shop in major cities. In the
          following years, many of these POGOs turned out to be fronts for
          online scam operations, leading to widespread calls from policymakers
          to ban the program altogether.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Myanmar presents a different picture. There, law from the 1980s
          completely prohibited gambling of any sort in the country, and only in
          2019 a new law permitted hotels of three stars and above to set up
          gambling venues for foreigners.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Still, despite the restrictions, some areas did develop casino
          industries, particularly border areas administered by ethnic armed
          organisations such as Kokang, Wa State, and Kayin State. However,
          these regions are not all easily accessible, operation costs are
          higher than elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia, and conflict risks
          high.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          In this environment, the online scam industry was likely attracted not
          so much by the existing infrastructure provided by online gambling,
          but rather by the opportunity to establish itself in places that are
          in many regards lawless. These border areas are effectively ruled by
          warlords often allied with the Myanmar military, who have for years
          operated myriad criminal operations, many of which are transnational
          in nature.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          The online scam industry experienced intense growth in northern and
          eastern Myanmar in the wake of the 2021 military coup and in the wake
          of a short-lived crackdown on the industry in Cambodia in late 2022,
          but its future is now uncertain due to intense crackdowns started in
          late 2023 by local actors in collaboration with Chinese law
          enforcement.

          Since the move to Southeast Asia, the online scam industry has grown
          exponentially. Although they were already raking in impressive
          profits, scam operators realised there was still much room for growth
          — they just had to find ways to secure larger workforces and
          supporting infrastructure to scale up their activities.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          While at the beginning scam operations were often small-scale and

            they have found a target, they start grooming them by showing care,
            sending gifts, and engaging in conversations that in some cases last
            for months.
          </p>
          <p class="pinned_content">
            Once the target is on the hook, the ‘pig-grooming period’ begins. At
            that point, the scammers recommend fake investment products or steer
            them to cryptocurrency or foreign exchange investment platforms that
            often mimic legitimate apps and sites.
          </p>
          <p class="pinned_content">
            The targets will be shown how to invest, and through the
            scammer-controlled platforms, they will see their investment
            steadily increase in value.
          </p>
          <p class="pinned_content">
            ‘Pig-slaughtering’ often comes when victims want to cash out or
            start to get suspicious. At this point, the scammers lock them out
            of the app and vanish.

          A second common strategy has a long history even outside the
          Chinese-speaking world and, contrarily to what some observers have
          claimed, and is not linked to the specific political situation of
          mainland China. This involves the impersonation of law enforcement
          officials.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          For instance, one of our informants, a young Chinese graduate student
          in the United Kingdom, one day received a call from someone claiming
          to be from the Chinese Embassy in London who informed her that she was
          in trouble and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau wanted
          her cooperation.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Wary, she checked the number that had popped up on her screen and it
          matched that of the embassy. The call was transferred to a second
          person claiming to be from the Shanghai police, who informed her that
          she was among the suspects in a serious case involving forged
          passports and money laundering. He warned her not to tell her family
          or friends because anyone who knew about the situation could be
          accused of harbouring criminals.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Soon after, another alleged police officer contacted her on the app
          Telegram, sent her what he claimed was an ‘arrest warrant’, and video
          called her to collect her testimony.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder">image/animaton: Telegram message</div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          For almost two months, she had to report her thoughts and activities
          to this " "officer" every day. After she was completely subjugated and
          dependent on him, he told her that if she wanted to prove her
          innocence, she had to transfer RMB500,000 (roughly US$72,500) to a
          designated "safe account" so that the police could escrow the money
          until all suspicions about her were cleared. After she did so, the
          scammers vanished.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Pig butchering and official impersonation scams require not only
          technological means, but also substantial investments in time and
          manpower. These frauds are highly scripted, with prospective scammers
          undergoing intensive training on how to use specific tools and
          dedicated phrasebooks, which are said to be possibly elaborated by
          professional psychologist and behavioural specialists.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Other types of scams are more basic. In some cases, scammers lure
          often inexperienced investors to put their money into buying or
          exchanging cryptocurrencies on phoney platforms by offering
          artificially high rates.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          In others, they flood dating apps with fake profiles, which are then
          used to induce targets into participating in compromising intimate
          chats or video calls.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          There are then the classic predatory loans and e-commerce scams that
          involve offering products for low prices on mainstream online
          marketplaces to entice victims.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          However, scammers can also be remarkably creative. For instance, over
          the past couple of years, there have been reports of frauds targeting
          Chinese students with a new bizarre technique. Scammers have been
          convincing their targets that they or their family are under
          investigation for financial crimes and persuade them to send them
          photos and videos of themselves staging their own kidnapping. They
          then use these materials to extort ransoms from their family members.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder float_right">image: Kidnapping pic</div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          For instance, in October 2022, two students in their early twenties
          living in Singapore were contacted by fake police officers who said
          they were under investigation for spreading misinformation, one about
          monkeypox and the second about Covid-19 in Guangdong.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          They were told they would have to assist in investigations and
          instructed to travel to Cambodia to conduct ‘missions’. Once in Phnom
          Penh, they were told to stay in separate hotels, cease all
          communication with family and friends, and record videos of themselves
          pretending to be kidnapped for the purpose of scam education and
          investigations.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder">Video: kidnapping (if possible)</div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          The fake kidnapping videos they filmed were sent to the parents with
          ransom demands totalling RMB2.8 million (US$390,000). Cambodian police
          located them before any ransoms were paid. **JB: are any of these
          videos able to be shown?**
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Kidnappings are not always staged. In one horrific instance in the
          summer of 2023, a 23-year-old Chinese student in New Zealand received
          a call from the ‘Chinese consulate’ saying they had received a
          complaint that someone was sending harassing texts from a phone number
          registered with her ID.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          She was told to file a police report and transferred to the ‘Chinese
          police department’.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          The fake police asked for her ID number and told her that there was a
          file on her and that she was also being investigated in a
          transnational money laundering case. The ‘police officer’ sent various
          official-looking documents to her, including an arrest warrant. He
          said that she could avoid investigation if she cooperated as a witness
          and travelled to Cambodia to identify the people involved.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          After arriving in Cambodia, she was taken to a compound near the
          border with Vietnam, where she was tortured, the video then sent to
          the family. Only a few days later she was rescued by the Cambodian
          police, alerted by the family.
        </p>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          With the techniques used by scammers already highly sophisticated, the
          emergence and accessibility of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools
          is creating more opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          For at least the past year, media reports have documented scams
          facilitated by ‘deep fake’ technology, where software is used to mimic
          the face or voice of someone known to the scam target. Additionally,
          generative AI tools can make it easier to send out phishing messages
          using duplicate or created backstories and trails of digital activity
          to make fake identities seem more believable.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          According to the head of the financial and economic crime unit at
          Europol, with large-language tools like ChatGPT ‘you can write
          thousands of tailored messages in different languages with different
          targets, different stories, and you can do that with your laptop from
          wherever.’

        <h2 class="sub_head">Going Global</h2>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          If the past few years spent observing the online scam industry have
          taught us anything, it is that the capital behind these operations is
          very mobile.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          As we have seen, scam operators seek locations where there is existing
          infrastructure they can take advantage of, such as reliable internet
          connectivity and telecommunication links, as well as office and
          accommodation space, ideally in coastal or border areas.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          If the physical infrastructure is lacking, it can still be created,
          but what is most essential is for operators to build connections with
          local elites and power brokers or tap into networks that have them.
          These connections are essential to ensure the ability of the scam
          compounds to continue to operate and generally exist in contexts where
          law enforcement is lax and corruption is rampant.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          This type of capital is also particularly sensitive to regulatory
          crackdowns, moving from one country to the next in a perpetual search
          for places where it can operate with impunity.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          When scam operators come under pressure in some areas—as happened,
          briefly, in Cambodia in September 2022 and then again in late 2023 in
          northern Myanmar—they are often able to simply pack up and move to a
          different location. Dozens of countries can provide a suitable base to
          these groups, as long as they can count on basic internet
          infrastructure and the protection and support of local friendly elites
          and complicit state actors.
        </p>

        <div class="media_placeholder">chart/map: new scam locations</div>

        <p class="basic_margin">
          Today fraud operations have gone truly global, with evidence of scam
          compounds appearing as far afield as Serbia, Turkey, Georgia, Mexico,
          Peru, and West Africa. As new technologies are developed and advance,
          online scams are only likely to become more sophisticated.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          While Chinese-ethnic criminal groups remain a dominant force in the
          sector, they are now flanked by a very diverse and growing cohort of
          local and transnational criminals, businessmen, corrupt state
          officials, politicians, and law enforcement officials from all over
          the world.
        </p>
        <p class="basic_margin">
          Likewise, there will never be any lack of people who are willing to
          travel to remote places following the mirage of making easy
          money—whether they know what they are getting into or not. Compound
          capitalism might change form again, but it is here to stay.
