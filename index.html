              Then in August 2022, a friend sent him a well-paid IT job

              contract offering US$1,500 per month, plus commissions and free

      <h2>An industry with victims on both sides</h2>
      <p>
        We have come across countless stories like this one in our extensive
        research into the online scam industry in Southeast Asia over the past
        few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        After travelling to Southeast Asia – sometimes willingly, other times
        through deception or trafficking networks – thousands of people from all
        walks of life have found themselves trapped inside compounds, subjected
        to around-the-clock surveillance and constant threats of arbitrary
        physical violence.
      </p>

        Their passports are often confiscated, meaning they are effectively
        stranded in a foreign country where they don't know anyone or speak the
        language. They are required to sign dubious contracts, which they cannot
        break without paying exorbitant fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some even endure sexual violence. A Taiwanese woman named Alice
        (pseudonym) told us that when she refused to engage in scam work, she
        was sold numerous times between compounds and repeatedly raped. Before
        she was finally rescued, the gangsters even threatened to lock her up in
        a brothel-like clubhouse at a scam compound to serve at the pleasure of
        the managers and workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
        The burgeoning online scam industry is unusual in that it creates two
        distinct sets of victims.

      <h2>How we conducted our research</h2>
      <p>We gravitated to this area of research in very different ways.</p>
      <div
        class="border-tc_red-400 flex aspect-video h-auto w-full items-center justify-center border"

        Ivan Franceschini had been researching Chinese investment in Southeast
        Asia, especially Cambodia, since the early 2010s, with a focus on labour
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ling Li used to work in Chinese law enforcement. For the past two years,
        she has become involved with civil society organisations in Cambodia
        helping people escape scam compounds and then repatriate to their home
        countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        And our third research partner, Mark Bo, has worked with local and
        international NGOs, development agencies and UN agencies in Cambodia.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the online scam industry began to gain prominence in Cambodia after
        the outbreak of the COVID pandemic, the three of us decided to document
        what we felt was becoming a new global humanitarian crisis. Our research
        will be published in a book in early 2025, entitled
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scam-Inside-Southeast-Cybercrime-Compounds/dp/1804296902"
          >Scam: Inside Southeast Asia’s Cybercrime Compounds</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book relies heavily on in-depth interviews that Ling conducted
        between 2022 and 2024 with over 70 survivors of compounds mostly located
        in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Through their words, we've been able to
        document the inner workings of the industry, why it has taken root in
        Southeast Asia, and what the victims endured inside the compounds and
        how they made their harrowing escapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've also scoured instant messaging apps, online job advertisement
        websites and social media platforms to understand how criminal groups
        recruit people into the industry. Through extensive interviews and
        engagement with rescue teams, civil society practitioners and law
        enforcement officers, we’ve also gained insight into how difficult it is
        to get people out of the compounds and shut them down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the compounds are strictly off-limits to the public, we also
        hired a photographer in 2022 to shoot aerial images from drones.
        Luckily, our trip to Sihanoukville, a Cambodian coastal city that has
        become a notorious scam hub, coincided with a short-lived government
        crackdown on the industry, which allowed us access to places that would
        normally be closed to outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we've also accumulated a wealth of data through years of
        observing the power networks and money flows that underpin the industry.
        It was surprising to us how much information was out there, if you knew
        where to look.
      </p>

      <h2>Rise of an Industry</h2>
      <p>
        The global online scam industry got its start in the 1990s (the early
        days of the internet) in Taiwan, when entrepreneurial fraudsters ran
        phone scams and began experimenting with the new technology to defraud
        unwitting targets.
      </p>
      <p>
        As law enforcement began cracking down on the industry in the early
        2000s, many scammers shifted their attention to mainland China. One
        county in Fujian Province called Anxi soon became synonymous with online
        fraud, eventually earning the nickname "scam township" in the Chinese
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to reporting from the time, Anxi’s scam operations often
        worked on a family-based model, supplemented by the hiring of external
        workers. These employees received either a fixed monthly salary or
        commission based on the money they brought in, along with food and
        accommodation. This basic set-up resembles the way today's massive scam
        compounds in Southeast Asia are organised, though we have no evidence
        these early workers were coerced or held against their will.
      </p>

        compounds in Southeast Asia are organised, though we have no evidence
        these early workers were coerced or held against their will.
      </p>
      <p>
        When police in China started to close in on these operations in the
        early 2010s, they uprooted again – this time for Southeast Asia, in
        particular Cambodia and the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        What attracted the operators to these countries – and later, Myanmar,
        Laos and others – was the lack of regulations, lax law enforcement and a
        protective umbrella of local elites willing to shield them from
        scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to
        <a
          href="http://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFDLAST2022&filename=LYWT202104004&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=rHtcXvdRnacZTIznmfxUGMFXAxq3LfS3wUEv1ij819Ah9gaQU9rN-Rch9HVkXYtX"
          >Chinese researchers</a
        >, the operations were largely still run by groups from Taiwan, so the
        proximity to both Taiwan and China facilitated a steady supply of
        Chinese-speaking workers. Later on, criminal groups from the mainland
        would become the most prominent force in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, these scam operations require decent infrastructure,
        especially in terms of internet connectivity, telecommunications and
        office space. As a result, many emerged in connection with casinos or
        online gambling operations, which were initially legal or at least
        tolerated in places like Cambodia and the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Cambodia, Sihanoukville became an epicentre of the scamming world,
        enabled in part by a massive influx of Chinese investment in the
        gambling and entertainment industry that started around 2017. Overnight,
        the once-sleepy city became awash with neon. Casinos, high-end hotels
        and condos were going up everywhere, pushing the local population to the
        margins.
      </p>

      <h2>Explosive growth</h2>
      <p>
        When the Cambodian government suddenly

          >cracked down</a
        >
        on online gambling in 2019, however, the local economy took a
        significant hit. Hundreds of construction projects were left unfinished,
        littering the city with skeletons of buildings. Many gambling operators
        were abruptly shut down, leaving behind a significant infrastructure
        ready for scammers to use solely for their own operations.

        online gambling operations in major cities in 2016 in an effort to
        regulate the freewheeling industry and collect revenue for the state.
        However, in the ensuing years, many of these operations became fronts
        for the far more lucrative scam industry. With the industry increasingly
        mired in scandal, in July 2024 President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. decided to
        ban online gaming operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a different story in Myanmar. Gambling was long outlawed in the
        country, with upscale hotels only permitted to open casinos for
        foreigners in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the restrictions, some areas did develop gambling industries,
        particularly in the border areas controlled by ethnic armed groups, such
        as Kokang, Wa state and Kayin state. These areas are effectively ruled
        by warlords often allied with the Myanmar military, who for years
        operated myriad criminal operations. In such an environment, online scam
        operations were able to thrive.

          >captured military-held towns in northern Shan state</a
        >, leading to an intense crackdown on scam operations in collaboration
        with Chinese law enforcement. But despite the repatriation of almost
        50,000 Chinese nationals, the industry continues to operate.**source
        here**
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyber-scam operations have also found a home in Laos. The vast majority
        of these compounds are located in the Golden Triangle Special Economic
        Zone, which has long been a notorious hub for various forms of
        transnational crime, such as illegal wildlife and drug trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it is harder to pinpoint their exact locations, scam operations
        also exist elsewhere in the country. We have found Chinese reports of
        arrests and deportations of Chinese nationals who have worked at
        compounds in the capital, Vientiane, and other locations.

        The sheer size of the industry makes it extremely difficult to assess
        exactly how many compounds exist in total, but through our monitoring of
        media reports, court and police reports, and Telegram channels, in
        addition to our victim testimonies, we have been able to identify more
        than 270 sites in Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos alone. There will no doubt
        be many more that have not crossed our radar.
      </p>

      <h2>'We could hear the screams continuing until midnight'</h2>
      <p>
        As the scam industry began to grow across Southeast Asia, the criminal
        syndicates running the compounds realised they could take advantage of
        the latest technological advancements and favourable local conditions to
        scale up their activities to make even more money.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning, scam operations were often small-scale and mostly
        located in apartments, villas and hotel rooms. By the mid-2010s,
        however, they began to coalesce into bigger, purpose-built compounds,
        with offices, dormitories, shops, entertainment venues and other
        amenities for workers. Some were established in buildings attached to or
        near licensed casinos.

          Huge compounds, like this one on the outskirts of Sihanoukville called
          "Chinatown" are like walled mini-cities.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        As they've scaled up, some scam operations have also become more
        professional and are now run as "proper" companies. They now have
        departments in charge of different sides of the business, such as
        recruitment, human resources, and logistics, with external contractors
        in charge of more technical aspects, such as money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, unlike companies in legitimate sectors, the compounds exert
        strict control over their workforce through round-the-clock surveillance
        and a "carrot and stick" approach to discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the carrot side, scam centre operators offer bonuses and other
        rewards to workers, such as access to drugs and sex in clubs and
        brothels inside the compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the words of one of our informants, a Chinese man named Tao
        (pseudonym) who was trapped in a scam compound in Cambodia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The ‘excellent employee’ would get monetary awards, promotions and
        sometimes the privilege to temporarily exit the compound. If you were
        one of them, they would buy you good food and take you to gamble or even
        pay for prostitutes to let you taste their rich life.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On the stick side, we found overwhelming evidence of torture and
        violence in the scam compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who could not meet their targets, however, life would quickly
        become a nightmare. These workers were beaten, subjected to electric
        shocks and in some cases even had their nails extracted. **this came
        from your interviews? or another source?**
      </p>
      <p>As Tao recounted to us:</p>
      <blockquote>
        We could hear the screams continuing until midnight […] They made sure
        you understand that you do not want to be the next one to end up in the
        punishment room.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Types of Scams</h2>
      <p>
        The scams themselves originally targeted people in the Chinese-speaking
        world, especially mainland China. However, in recent years, they have
        gone global.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States alone in 2022, losses from

        >
        reported by the public to the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center
        totalled US$3.31 billion (nearly A$5 billion).
      </p>
      <p>
        Scams involving cryptocurrency, including those commonly called “<a
          href="https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/pig-butchering-scam-targeting-australians-afp-warns-lonely-hearts-be-wary"
          >pig butchering</a
        >” which we’ll describe later, were the most common. These resulted in
        reported losses of US$2.57 billion (A$3.85 billion) (a 183% increase
        from the previous year).
      </p>
      <p>
        In China, one of the biggest target nations, authorities managed to
        <a href="https://m.yicai.com/news/101950838.html">stop scams</a> valuing
        some 328.8 billion yuan in 2023, roughly US$45.29 billion (A$68
        billion).
      </p>
      <p>
        “Pig butchering” (or <em>sha zhu pan</em> in Mandarin) is one of the
        scam techniques that has attracted most attention. This technique sits
        at the intersection of traditional romance and investment scams. It
        generally entails four stages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>pig finding (<em>zhao zhu</em>)</li>
        <li>pig feeding (<em>wei zhu</em>)</li>
        <li>pig grooming (<em>yang zhu</em>)</li>
        <li>pig slaughtering (<em>sha zhu</em>)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One pig butchering scam victim who spoke to us described how she was
        approached through WhatsApp.

        One day after this innocuous exchange the scammer got back in touch...

            I did my conference successfully despite the small translation
            problem. Again, apologisies for talking so rudely to you and the
            inconvenience. How was your day? It is my first time in Hong Kong,
            I'm just so excited to e-meet you because of that "accident".
          </p>

      <p>
        Then the scammer began messaging the victim daily, sharing details of
        his life. Over the course of 2-3 months, they became quite close. The
        scammer presented himself as a succesful investor in cryptocurrency,
        futures contracts, and similar ventures – he even shared a photo.
      </p>

        As their relationship deepened, the scammer encouraged the victim to
        invest with him.

      <p>
        Predictably, the scammer then cut all ties and deleted her from his
        contacts.
      </p>

      <h2>Increasingly dangerous scams</h2>
      <p>
        A second common strategy involves the impersonation of law enforcement
        officials.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, one of our informants, a young Chinese graduate student in
        the United Kingdom, told us about a call she received from someone
        claiming to be from the Chinese embassy in London. The caller said she
        was in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        The student was immediately suspicious and checked the number on the
        embassy website – it matched. Scammers do this by using caller ID
        “spoofing” technology. The call was then transferred to someone claiming
        to be from the Shanghai police, who told the student she was a suspect
        in a case involving forged passports and money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, another "police officer" sent her what he claimed was an arrest
        warrant on Telegram and set up a video call to record her "testimony".
      </p>
      <p>
        The calls continued daily for almost two months. Eventually, the student
        fell under the "officer's" complete control. When he told her to
        transfer RMB500,000 (roughly US$72,500, or A$108,000) to a designated
        "safe account", which would be held in escrow until the allegations
        against her were cleared up, she did. The scammers then disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scams require substantial investments in time and manpower. They
        are highly scripted frauds that entail intensive training on how to use
        specific tools and dedicated phrasebooks, such as the one below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other scams are more basic and involve smaller amount of money but at
        large volume. These include e-commerce scams, parcel delivery phishing
        scams and predatory loan scams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scammers can also be remarkably creative. For instance, Hong Kong police
        issued an alert in February 2023 targeting animal lovers. One executive
        had been
        <a
          href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-scam-thailand-kitten-hong-kong-woman-lose-2023-2"
          >duped</a
        >
        out of cryptocurrency worth HK$6 million (roughly US$770,000, or A$1.15
        million) after responding to a post about an abandoned kitten up for
        adoption in Thailand. She paid delivery and other costs upfront, but was
        then told the kitten died on the way. She lost more money when she was
        asked to pay an administrative fee to claim insurance compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, we also found reports of frauds targeting Chinese
        students with a bizarre new technique – staging their own kidnappings.

      <p>
        For instance, in October 2022, two students living in Singapore
        <a
          href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/staged-kidnap-scam-victims-students-cambodia-singapore-fake-china-police-3030701"
          >were contacted</a
        >
        by fake police officers who said they were being investigated for
        spreading misinformation online about monkeypox and COVID.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were told to fly to Cambodia to assist in the investigation, but
        once there, were forced to make videos pretending to be kidnapped,
        ostensibly as part of a “scam education” exercise. Instead, the videos
        were sent to their parents with ransom demands totalling RMB2.8 million
        (US$390,000, or A$585,000). They were rescued by Cambodian police before
        any ransom was paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kidnappings are not always staged. According to
        <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/R2wyviAOrQ2nubERegvcuw"
          >Chinese-language media</a
        >
        in Cambodia, in 2023 a 23-year-old Chinese **woman in Shanghai** was
        similarly contacted by fake police and told she was under investigation
        for money laundering and sending harassing text messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The officer sent what appeared to be official-looking documents,
        including an arrest warrant, but was told if she agreed to be a witness
        in the investigation, she could avoid trouble. She flew to Cambodia and
        was taken to a compound near the Vietnamese border where she was
        tortured. **This included her finger being chopped off with a knife.** A
        video was sent to her family with a demand for a ransom of 5 million
        yuan (US$688,000, or A$1 million). She was later rescued by local
        police.
      </p>

      <h2>Going Global</h2>
      <p>
        If our research over the past few years has taught us anything, it's
        that the capital behind these operations is very mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        While physical infrastructure is key to these operations, so is the
        access to local political and business elites and powerbrokers. In
        countries like Cambodia, where law enforcement is lax and corruption
        endemic, these connections ensure that scam compounds can continue to
        operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when the authorities do launch a crackdown – which happened briefly
        in Cambodia in late 2022 and in northern Myanmar in late 2023 – the
        mobile nature of the industry allows scammers to pack up and move to a
        new location quickly. This relocation may be within the country or
        across borders. Scam operations have expanded to places like Serbia,
        Turkey, Georgia, Mexico, Peru and west Africa in recent years, among
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As new technologies continue to be developed – such as artificial
        intelligence – online scams are only likely to become more sophisticated
        and widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
        While ethnic Chinese criminal groups remain a dominant force in the
        sector, they are now flanked by a very diverse and growing cohort of
        local and transnational criminals, businessmen, corrupt state officials,
        politically connected elites and law enforcement officials all over the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, there will never be any lack of people who are willing to
        travel to remote places with the lure of making easy money, whether they
        know what they are getting into or not. In part two of our series, we'll
        look more deeply at the victims who work in these compounds (either
        voluntarily or under duress), how they are recruited, what they
        experienced inside, and how they managed to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scam compounds will continue to evolve, but the industry on the
        whole is no doubt here to stay.
